	abstract = {A low Reynolds number airfoil was designed for applications in small horizontal axis wind turbines to achieve better startup and low wind speed performances. Experiments were performed on the improved airfoil (AF300) in an open circuit wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers of 38,000, 75,000, 128,000 and 205,000. Pressure distributions were obtained over the surface of the airfoil and the lift and drag forces were measured with a dynamometer at different angles of attack, α. A CFD analysis was also performed to get additional information on the flow characteristics. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) together with smoke flow visualization were used to study the flow around the airfoil. At the Reynolds numbers of 75,000, 128,000 and 205,000, maximum lift coefficients of 1.72, 1.81 and 1.86 respectively were obtained at the stall angle of 14°. The lift coefficient increased from 0.41 to 1.05 at Re = 38,000 in the α range of 0–18°, in which no stalling was documented. The results from PIV and smoke flow visualization showed that the flow stayed fully attached to the airfoil surface from Re as low as 56,000 at an angle of attack of 8° and maintained a fully attached flow up to 14° angle of attack for Re as low as 75,000.},

Therefore, the optimization of airfoil is necessary before the design of nano rotor. Nano rotor blade airfoil optimization is a multi-objective problem since the airfoil suffers a wide range of Reynolds number which increases the difficulty of optimization. In this paper, the airfoil of nano rotor was optimized based on the controlled elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) coupling with the parameterization method of Class function/Shape function Transformation technique (CST) and the multi-objectives function processing method of statistical definition of stability. An airfoil was achieved with the thickness of 2\% and the maximum camber of 5.6\% at 2/3 of chord. Airfoil optimized exhibits a good aerodynamic performance at ultra-low Reynolds number according to the computational results. And comparisons were carried out between the performance of the rotor designed with airfoil optimized and that of the rotor designed with AG38 airfoil, which showed that the airfoil optimized was suitable for rotor design.},

	abstract = {Vorrichtungen, welche die kinetische Energie der Luftströmung in mechanische Arbeit umsetzen, sind in großer Vielfalt denkbar und in den skurrilsten Formen vorgeschlagen worden. Die praktische Verwendbarkeit schränkt die Anzahl der wichtigen Bauarten drastisch ein. Windenergiekonverter lassen sich einmal hinsichtlich ihrer aerodynamischen Wirkungsweise unterscheiden und zum anderen nach ihrer konstruktiven Bauweise einordnen. Für die aerodynamische Wirkungsweise ist die Tatsache kennzeichnend, ob der Windenergiewandler seine Leistung ausschließlich aus dem Luftwiderstand seiner im Luftstrom bewegten Flächen bezieht, oder ob er in der Lage ist, den aerodynamischen Auftrieb, der bei der Umströmung geeignet profilierter Flächen entsteht, zu nutzen. Man unterscheidet dementsprechend reine Widerstandsläufer und auftriebsnutzende Windenergiekonverter. Gelegentlich wird auch die sogenannte aerodynamische Schnelläufigkeit als Merkmal zur Kennzeichnung herangezogen und von „Langsam- und Schnelläufern“ gesprochen. Eine Unterscheidung nach konstruktiven Gesichtspunkten ist aus verständlichen Gründen praktikabler und damit auch gebräuchlicher. Das augenscheinlichste Merkmal ist die Lage der Drehachse des Windrotors. Man unterscheidet deshalb Rotoren mit vertikaler und horizontaler Drehachse.},

	abstract = {This semester project is aiming to compare different airfoils in order to select the most promising one as blade shape for scaled the straight-bladed giromills used in wind tunnel experiments. For this matter, a large amount of steady-state CFD-simulations have been performed trying to characterize aerodynamic airfoil's performance at low Reynolds number. It is a continuation of a previous semester project which already selected the numerical model to use for the simulation and developed an automation process for batching several simulations which facilitated the creation of the dataset presented in this report. In total, thirteen profiles have been investigated through various angles of attack and for chord Reynolds numbers of 1x10{\textasciicircum}4, 2x10{\textasciicircum}4 and 4x10{\textasciicircum}4. The airfoils chosen consist of the symmetrical NACA profiles of different thicknesses (NACA 0005 to NACA 0021), three modified NACA with sharp leading edge (NACA 0005-05, NACA 0009-05 and NACA0012-05), two 5\% cambered NACA profiles (NACA 5505 and NACA 5510) and three specific airfoils for low Reynolds number (E387, S1223 and BW3). Based on the tangential force coefficients of the airfoils, NACA5505 and BW3 showed the overall best performances at this range of Reynolds which is in accordance with the existing studies on the subject as they are both thin airfoils with around 5\% maximum camber at mid chord.},

Das Verdienst diese Erkenntnisse zum ersten Male auf den Windrotor angewendet zu haben gebührt dem deutschen Physiker Albert Betz. In seinen 1922–1925 erschienenen Schriften konnte er durch die Anwendung elementarer physikalischer Gesetze zeigen, dass die entnehmbare mechanische Leistung aus einem Luftstrom, der durch eine vorgegebene Querschnittsfläche strömt, auf einen ganz bestimmten Wert im Verhältnis zu der im Luftstrom enthaltenen Leistung begrenzt ist. Obwohl die Betzsche Theorie Vereinfachungen enthält, sind die Ergebnisse durchaus für praktische Überschlagsberechnungen brauchbar. Ihre wahre Bedeutung liegt jedoch darin, dass sie eine gemeinsame physikalische Grundlage für das Verständnis und die Wirkungsweise von Windenergiewandlern unterschiedlicher Bauart bildet. Aus diesem Grund wird im Folgenden eine kurz gefasste mathematische Herleitung der elementaren „Impulstheorie“ von Betz wiedergegeben.},

Die Rotorblätter werden als Schlüsselkomponente für die technische Weiterentwicklung der gesamten Windkraftanlage angesehen.

The research aims to optimize the protuberance design of HAWT blades for the system to gain optimal performance under low speed rotations, whereas no significant drop of performance happens at high tip speed ratios. The optimization study was performed not only for baseline blades but also for those designed by the blade element momentum theory. For verifications, wind tunnel experiments were carried out to provide comparative data; additionally, numerical simulations were also conducted to further visualize the flow fields. The results show that the optimal leading-edge protuberances would significantly increase the HAWT performance under low speed rotations, yet no serious performance payback occurs at high tip speed ratios.},

	abstract = {Miniature wind turbines, employed in wind tunnel experiments to study the interaction of turbines with turbulent boundary layers, usually suffer from poor performance with respect to their large-scale counterparts in the field. Moreover, although wakes of wind turbines have been extensively examined in wind tunnel studies, the proper characterization of the performance of wind turbines has received relatively less attention. In this regard, the present study concerns the design and the performance analysis of a new three-bladed horizontal-axis miniature wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 15 cm. Due to its small size, this turbine, called WiRE-01, is particularly suitable for studies of wind farm flows and the interaction of the turbine with an incoming boundary-layer flow. Especial emphasis was placed on the accurate measurement of the mechanical power extracted by the miniature turbine from the incoming wind. In order to do so, a new setup was developed to directly measure the torque of the rotor shaft. Moreover, to provide a better understanding on the connection between the mechanical and electrical aspects of miniature wind turbines, the performance of three different direct-current (DC) generators was studied. It is found that electrical outputs of the tested generators can be used to provide a rather acceptable estimation of the mechanical input power. Force and power measurements showed that the thrust and power coefficients of the miniature turbine can reach     0.8     and     0.4    , respectively, which are close to the ones of large-scale turbines in the field. In Part II of this study, the wake structure and dynamic flow characteristics are studied for the new miniature turbine immersed in a turbulent boundary-layer flow.},

The paper will highlight the rotor design process, based on contemporary methods of experiment-simulation integration approach and use of rapid manufacturing techniques. In-house wind tunnel measurements of a scaled model performance were executed. A numerical analysis using dedicated software (QBlade) was conducted in parallel. A comparison between the obtained results indicated that the chosen numerical tools are capable of providing a reliable output, even in complex, transitional flow conditions. Bearing in mind the above observations, QBlade was incorporated into the development process of a completely new blade geometry which would increase rotor performance.

	abstract = {Flow separation characteristics for two tapered swept-back wings, one with straight leading-edge (LE) and the other with tubercled LE, were investigated in a water tunnel using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) technique. The two wings were based on the SD7032 aerofoil profile, with Reynolds number Re = 1.4 × 104, close to the working condition for common underwater gliders. The LE tubercles were designed such that the amplitude decreased linearly from the wing root to wing tip, while retaining constant wavelength. Results indicate that the baseline wing shows significantly separated flow in the outboard region at pitch angle of 10° and 20°, and the flow remains attached in the inboard region due to relatively larger local Reynolds number. Implementation of LE tubercles can mitigate flow separation downstream of both troughs and peaks. At higher pitch angles, the separated flows cover most of the baseline wing surface, whereas flow remains attached downstream most of tubercle peaks. Streamwise aligned counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs) formed over the tubercles are significantly tilted and asymmetrical due to the sweep and amplitude difference between the two sides of tubercle. Consequently, weaker vortices in CVPs close to the wing root are rapidly dissipated, allowing the CVPs to evolve into a series of co-rotating vortices (CVs), which exerted significant impact on flow separation characteristics downstream of the tubercles.},

	abstract = {Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) are scaled down to incorporate rotor blades that usually have a diameter ranging from two to four meters in length. A common misconception with regard to selection of airfoils followed by subsequent designing of rotor blades involves the use of NACA airfoils and other conventional high Reynolds number airfoils. Micro horizontal axis wind turbines usually operate at low Reynolds number conditions along the blade length. Conventional aerodynamic schemes cannot be applied to rotor blades operating under low Reynolds number conditions as compared to those occurring under high Reynolds number conditions since certain unusual aerodynamic phenomena predominate in the case of the former. The efficiency of a wind turbine is largely dependent on blade optimization, which is why airfoil selection of the rotor blade is of considerable importance. The difference between high and low Reynolds number operation is the onset of boundary layer transition. In the case of high Reynolds number operation, as is the case of aircraft propellers and other high speed turbines, boundary layer transition takes place before laminar separation, which is in direct contrast to low Reynolds number boundary layer phenomena, wherein laminar separation takes place before boundary layer transition.},

Improvement in material properties encourages makers and engineers to embrace this technology even for load-bearing applications. Mechanical properties of 3D-printed materials are difficult to obtain from technical datasheets and, even when available, these data are often unreliable, since they depend strongly on the specific printing parameters applied. Therefore, it is often necessary to perform an in-house mechanical characterization. In this work, tensile tests are performed with a basic in-house-designed tester on SLA 3D-printed specimens; these are printed at different orientations on a Formlabs™ Form 2™ using Clear V4™ resin. The ultimate tensile strength, Young’s modulus, strain at maximum stress and strain at break are calculated. No relationship is found between printing angle and mechanical characteristics; therefore, this 3D-printed material can be considered isotropic. Results are compared with the manufacturer’s datasheet: the measured maximum stress is slightly lower than that stated by Formlabs™, while the modulus is nearly the same. Strain at maximum stress and strain at break were also measured but were not reported in the available datasheet.},

	abstract = {The present study introduces a low Reynolds number (Re) airfoil family for the entire blade span of small wind turbines, aiming to reduce the effects related to laminar separation, improve startup response and meet acceptable levels of structural integrity. Six airfoils of varying relative thickness were designed by increasing the thickness distribution of RG15 airfoil up to 50\% and adopting a rounded trailing edge with a diameter equal to 1\% of the chord length. The aerodynamic performance of RG15 family was initially evaluated by means of XFOIL code at several low Reynolds numbers ranging from 60,000 to 300,000 and angles of attack between − 6° and 14°. XFOIL analysis revealed that increasing relative thickness leads to the reduction of maximum lift-to-drag ratio \$\$(C\_\{L\} /C\_\{D\} )\$\$. However, this percentage reduction decreases with increasing Re. The maximum reduction in maximum \$\$C\_\{L\} /C\_\{D\}\$\$was found at 60,000 Re for the thickest airfoil of RG15 family. Conversely, a growth of maximum lift coefficient \$\$(C\_\{L\} )\$\$was observed by increasing relative thickness. Besides, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) analysis was also conducted at 300,000 Re to get additional information on the flow characteristics. Comparisons between the XFOIL and RANS data were performed. The results of RANS simulations were generally in accordance with those of XFOIL. However, notable over-estimations of drag coefficient \$\$(C\_\{D\} )\$\$were detected. The behavior of the recirculation area behind the rounded trailing edge and that of the separation bubble near the leading edge for different values of relative thickness and angle of attack was examined. Thickening of the airfoils was found to have a beneficial impact on the appearance of separation bubbles, while no significant effect of the rounded trailing edge on \$\$C\_\{L\}\$\$and \$\$C\_\{D\}\$\$was observed.},

A simple design optimization methodology with the integration of XFOIL in the modeFRONTIER workflow environment is proposed in this study. The proposed “software integration methodology” demonstrated up to 10\% improvement in the optimization parameter which makes it more efficient by reducing the optimization time and steps without unnecessary user intervention which are the limitations conventionally associated with the optimization process. The optimization results are further compared with the results of the numerical simulations. The use of the transition-sensitive turbulence model allowed the evaluation of the behavior of the laminar separation bubble for different angles of attack, observing that it shifts towards the leading edge and has its length reduced as the angle of attack increases. The newly generated airfoil exhibits improved aerodynamic characteristics as compared to the base airfoil. The optimized airfoil can be used in the applications of UAVs as well as in general aviation. Further validation of the airfoil using wind tunnel testing is recommended and planned.},

	abstract = {As the computational resources available to aerodynamicists increase, so does the number of tools with which they can analyze their designs. The key skill of a good engineer is understanding when each tool produces realistic results. Even if no available tool can capture all relevant physical phenomena, this knowledge allows engineers to alter their designs to account for the missing physics. However, with the increasing use of numerical optimization for aerodynamic shape design, the opportunity for this intuition to shape the design is reduced as the optimizer makes design decisions based purely on numerical results. This makes the choice of analysis method critical. Previous studies have compared panel-based aerodynamic tools and RANS CFD to predict and analyze the key aerodynamic phenomena in different flight conditions. But few, if any, have compared the impact of proper tool selection on the optimal aerodynamic shapes. In this work we show the effect of aerodynamic analysis method selection on the optimal aerodynamic shape and the consequences of choosing one that does not capture the relevant flow physics. In particular, we show that modelling boundary layer transition can produce significantly lower drag designs across almost the entire range of Reynolds numbers at which airfoils are used in practice. Additionally, we find that the simple compressibility correction used in XFOIL is sufficient to produce well performing airfoils for flight Mach numbers up to 0.65, after which point the ability for the flow solver to model shock formation is critical. Our results will provide aerodynamicists with the data and intuition to make informed decisions when selecting analysis methods for optimization.},

	abstract = {Low Reynolds number flows may encounter some phenomena like stall, hysteresis, laminar separation bubble. etc., which can deteriorate the performance or efficiency of aerodynamic devices, including wind turbines. This study investigates the effect of the Humpback whale inspired leading edge tubercle on these characteristics, especially stall and hysteresis by comparing a tubercle blade with its baseline counterpart. Surface pressure measurements on various span wise locations of the blades as well as force measurement are done at Reynolds number ranging from 2.5×105 to 6.5×105. For all Reynolds numbers studied, there is a deterioration in stall angle when tubercles are introduced on the blade. The baseline blade experiences abrupt single step deep stall whereas tubercle blade experiences soft stall in multiple steps. From the surface pressure analysis, it is seen that the baseline blade stalls initially at the middle section which further progresses to the tips with increase in angle of attack. However, the stall progression to the tips is drastically inhibited for tubercle blade. It is also seen that there exists significant hysteresis loop for baseline model at all the studied Reynolds numbers. The extent or size of the hysteresis loop is dependent on the Reynolds number. This phenomenon of hysteresis is absent for tubercle blade. Surface pressure over baseline blade for a specific post stall angle of attack shows two distinct pressure distributions- one for increasing branch of angle of attack and one for the decreasing branch. Identical pressure distribution is obtained for tubercle blade irrespective of the direction of movement of blade. Clear regions of laminar separation bubble can be seen for baseline, whereas it is absent for tubercle blade.},

Inspired by the tubercles on the pectoral flipper leading-edge of the humpback whale, the most acrobatic of baleen whales, sinusoidal leading-edge have been used as a passive flow control method to enhance the stall characteristics of lifting surfaces in different applications. They are supposed to reduce the lift gradually during the stall with an increase in the post-stall lift, however, their enhancement ability in pre- and post-stall is highly dependent on the geometrical parameters and the flow regime. Two different design schemes: nonlinear shear transformation design scheme (NLST) and channelled-like scheme, of the sinusoidal leading edge of the high lift airfoil S1223 are tested and compared with the unmodified airfoil at angles of attack of −6 to 30 degrees experimentally inside a wind tunnel at low Reynolds number Re = 100,000. Experimental data show that Tubercles implemented on S1223 at such a flow regime with either design scheme enhance the post-stall characteristics as much as a 42\% increase in lift at some angles for NLST with pre-stall lift penalties. NLST, compared with baseline and channelled models, exhibit a significant increase in aerodynamic efficiency which make it more preferable for wind turbines applications.},

	abstract = {Low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil design is critical to the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). However, since laminar-to-turbulent transition dominates the aerodynamic performance of low-Reynolds-number airfoils and the transition position may exhibit an abrupt change even with a small geometric deformation, aerodynamic coefficient functions become discontinuous in this regime, which brings significant difficulties to the application of conventional aerodynamic design optimization methods. To efficiently perform low-Reynolds-number airfoil design, we present a tailored airfoil modal parameterization method, which reasonably defines the desired design space using deep-learning techniques. Coupled with surrogate-based optimization, the proposed method has shown to be effective and efficient in low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil design. It is found that it is necessary to consider laminar-to-turbulent transition and to perform multi-point optimization in practical low-Reynolds-number airfoil design. The maximal lift coefficient is an active constraint influencing the selection of the optimal cruise lift coefficient. The results show the complexity of low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil design and highlight the significance of the proposed method in the improvement of optimization efficiency.},

	abstract = {The majority of wind power is currently produced on high wind speed sites by large wind turbine, whereas small wind turbines often operate in light wind conditions. Small capacity wind turbines have not received the same engineering attention as their larger counterparts. This is partially due to a number of unique problems that small wind turbines experience. The most relevant are: low operating Reynolds number (Re{\textless}500,000), and poor performance at high angles of attack. Low and medium wind speed sites (Class II–IV) are more common than high wind speed sites, meaning there is a large source of energy not being taken advantage of. Several studies have suggested that flow control devices such as the spherical tubercle could be used to increase lift before stall and generate more power in such situations. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of tubercle amplitude on aerodynamic performance of an airfoil at low-Re numbers (Re=300,000\&Re=400,000). Three amplitudes were considered in this study: A1=0.005c, A2=0.01c, and A3=0.03c. A detailed 2D simulation study is carried out, using FLUENT (a commercial CFD software) and the TransitionSSTk−ω turbulence model, to obtain aerodynamic coefficients and flow characteristics. Results indicate that small tubercles perform better overall than larger tubercles. The airfoil with the smallest tubercle outperforms the unmodified airfoil at both studied Reynolds numbers at angles of attack 0° – 4 °. Moreover, the airfoil with the largest tubercle outperformed all of the airfoils at an angle of attack of 0° and Re=300,000. The analysis of the aerodynamic coefficients indicates that the improvement of the aerodynamic performance of airfoils with tubercles is due to the reduction of the drag coefficient. Pressure, intermittency and wall shear stress contours suggest that the overall drag reduction is achieved through the decrease of friction drag. The decrease in friction drag is attributed to the thickening of the laminar boundary layer, caused by a more favorable pressure distribution around the airfoils with the aerodynamic improvements. Moreover, the drastic deterioration in aerodynamic performance at higher angles of attack is attributed to the turbulence generated by the tubercles. This study suggests that spherical tubercles could have a potential application in small wind turbines.},

In this study, along with a baseline model with no tubercles (T0), in total four different configurations are used for analysis of the aerodynamic characteristics. In the other three models (T1, T2, T3) mainly different amplitude and wavelength modulations are studied. In all experimental studies, force measurements are performed by using a six-axis load cell force measurement device. To achieve detailed information on the flow field of all models, surface oil flow visualization technique is used for visualization purposes at Re = 1.1 × 105. The geometric specifications of the model are the sweep angle of 30⁰, the tip chord of 37.5 mm, the root chord of 112.5 mm, and the span of 300 mm. Airfoil models with the LE tubercles significantly improve lift curve at almost all AoAs as compared to the baseline model. The streamwise vortices are positioned together more closely leading to interaction with each other. Consequently, these interactions lead to an increase in turbulence. This increase in turbulence may lead to a better mixing and increase in momentum exchange in the boundary layer.

The purpose of this paper is to simulate and optimize the airfoil to get better aerodynamic performances at low Reynolds numbers. The Parsec method was selected for the optimization of the NACA 0012 airfoil. Both of these airfoils are simulated using CFD Fluent between 0 to 13-degree angle of attack at a low Reynolds number of 200000. To simulate the airfoil, mesh generation is crucial so an O-grid structured mesh is created. After the simulation, several aerodynamic performances are compared between the airfoils, such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, pressure coefficient, and lift-to-drag ratio. And the calculated results from Xfoil are taken as references. Between NACA 0012 and optimized NACA 0012, the optimized airfoil showed better aerodynamic performances than the normal one, which was the goal of this paper. Later on, the different flow field variables, such as density, temperature, pressure, and vorticity magnitude were analyzed and compared. Both the airfoils at a different angle of attack were analyzed for these functions, like 7°, 11°, and 20° AOA. During the analytical process, Q-criterion appears to be a very important method of vortex identification in the flow field. With this analysis, we came to know, that as the angle of attack increases the adverse pressure gradient also increases, which creates a big reverse flow.},
